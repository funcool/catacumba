## Version 1.0.0 ##

Date: 2016-08-17

Important changes (mostly breaking):

- Remove useless open abstraction for handler factory.
- Remove DefaultContext type and simplify related functions.
- Remove ring adapter (seems like it not very useful).
- Remove postal handlers.
  After using it some time, seems that it has no advantadges over
  standard REST api and has a lot of disadvantatges. If someone want
  continue using it, the code-base is very small and it can be
  maintained out of main codebase.
- Body reading is now **asynchronous**.
  This change implies removing `:body` key from context and provide
  a special function for asynchronously reading body.
  You will be able to restore the previous behavior adding a new
  `parse/read-body` handler on the start of the routing pipeline
  or server decorators (that just reads the body and puts it inside
  the context).
- `get-formdata` function becomes asynchronous and now returns
  a promise of parsed files.
- Upgrade ratpack version to 1.4.0.
- Upgrade netty version to 4.1.4 Final.
- Add edn `application/edn` support for `body-params` handler.

Date: 2016-06-05

- Update promesa version to 0.7.0.
- Update cats version to 1.2.1.
- Update potemkin version to 0.4.3.


## Version 0.9.0 ##

Date: 2015-12-10

Important changes:

- The `catacumba.handlers` namespace is no longuer available. It was a some
  kind of aggregator of different sub namespaces. The problem with it has
  includes some sub namespaces and some not. For remove the inconsistences
  it was removed. Now you should include the concrete namespace for use
  a concrete functionallity (**BREAKING CHANGE**).
- The `catacumba.handlers.interceptor`, `catacumba.handlers.cors` and
  `catacumba.handlers.autoreload` has moved into one unique namespace called
  `catacumba.handlers.misc` (**BREAKING CHANGE**).
- Add the decorators concept for attach some "root" handlers on the server
  startup.
- The routing policy for methos is changed from catch all to delegate.
  This is means that if you are declaring `get` and `post` methods to
  to the same path it will works as expected. Before that change you
  have to mandatory use `:by-method` for solving that. The `:by-method`
  routing directive is now deprecated becuase is not longuer necessary.
  This is mostly backward compatible change.
- Replace promissum with promesa, that is now cross-platform promise
  library (before it was only for cljs).


Other changes:

- Add proper support for tls/ssl
- Update ratpack to 1.1.1
- Update netty to 4.1.0.Beta7
- Add postal handlers.
- Add request logging facilities.


## Version 0.8.1 ##

Date: 2015-10-17

- Add support for handlers chaining on `:by-method` routing
  directive.
- Add .travis.yml and test catacumba using clojure 1.7 and 1.8.
- Update promissum to 0.3.2.


## Version 0.8.0 ##

Date: 2015-10-12

- Session handler and storage abstraction refactored
  to be more flexible and support cookie signed like
  session storages.
- Add csrf documentation.
- Improve csrf security handler implementation.
- Start using ratpack's chain `.path` method instread of
  `.prefix` for attach handlers for `:any` and `:all` routing
  directives. (This a more correct way to handle it and it
  should not cause regressions).
- Add restful handlers. This will allow build and expose
  restful resources in a simpler way.
- Fix wrong connection close handling when it is abruptly
  closed by peer (issue inherited from ratpack).
- Allow websocket extensions to be used.
- Allow setup native ratpack handlers directly in router.
- Update component to 0.3.0.
- Update environ to 1.0.1.
- Update buddy-sign to 0.7.1.


## Version 0.7.1 ##

Date: 2015-09-19

- Upgrade buddy-sign to 0.7.0


## Version 0.7.0 ##

Date: 2015-09-19

- Upgrade to ratpack 1.0.0
- Upgrade to promissum 0.3.0
- Upgrade to cats 1.0.0
- Improve the auth handlers and its support for multiple backends.
- Add transit encoding support for body-parsing handler.


## Version 0.6.2 ##

Date: 2015-08-31

- Properly collect all route params when using multiple route nesting.
  (Thanks to @prepor for report and patch)


## Version 0.6.1 ##

Date: 2015-08-24

- Fix wrong handling of route parameters together with context cache strategy.


## Version 0.6.0 ##

Date: 2015-08-22

- Improved inconsistences on response handling.
  Now the manifold stream and the reactive-stream published
  are not allowed as response value bacause them represents
  a collection of values and this consept does not fits well
  with response that is one unique value. They continue to be
  supported as body value. This is a BREAKING CHANGE.
- Reimplement the context management.
  Now is behaves like any other response value instead of special
  case and does not requires contex as first parameter. This change
  allows remove the special case for CPS style handler and also allow
  the fully asynchronous handlers chain.
  This is a BREAKING CHANGE because the signature of the `delegate`
  function is changed: it longer accepts context as parameter and
  now it should be a return value of the handler in sync or async
  way.
- The keys of the headers, query-params and form params maps are
  now keywordized. BREAKING CHANGE.
- Performance improvements on context building across handlers
  chain execution process.
- The slf4j-simple is no longer included by default. So if you
  want the previous behavior, just include `[org.slf4j/slf4j-simple "1.7.12"]`
  on your dependency list.


## Version 0.5.0 ##

Date: 2015-08-11

- Removed `get-body` function.
- The context is rich by default with keyword access to all most used
  request attributes such as body, http method, headers, cookies, params, etc...
- Websocket internals are rewritten (now they uses completable futures for
  backpressure control).
- The `parse-queryparams` is replaced by `get-query-params`, and is should
  not be used directly by the user because the parsed query params are directly
  available in context through the `:query-params` entry.
- Update to ratpack 0.9.19 and prepare code to up coming ratpack 1.0.0 (that
  implies a lot of changes in the catacumba internals and performance
  improvements).
- Add classpath basedir resolve method (thanks to @mitchelkuijpers).
- Make more easy the example project maintenance.
- Add websocket-echo example (thanks to @mitchelkuijpers).


## Version 0.4.0 ##

Date: 2015-07-19

- Make `:assets` routing directive to be more flexible (breaking change).
- Change the signature of the `:by-method` routing directive (breaking change).
- Fix wrong return value on session auth backend.
- Use `promissum` library instead of `futura`.
- Import the `streams` implementation from `futura` library (`futura` library
  is no longer used by _catacumba_).
- Remove `buddy-auth` dependency that is now completelly useless.
- Update to ratpack 0.9.18
- Update buddy dependency to 0.6.0
- Update potemkin to 0.4.1
